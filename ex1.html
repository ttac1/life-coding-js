      JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled
      programming language with first-class functions. While it is most
      well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
      environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe
      Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded,
      dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative
      (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript. This
      section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts
      that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information
      about API specifics to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM. The
      standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers
      fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript
      3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major version
      of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was
      initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript
      standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to the
      latest draft version, which is currently ECMAScript 2020. Do not confuse
      JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and
      "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S.
      and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very
      different syntax, semantic, and use.
